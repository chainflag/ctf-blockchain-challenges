  #### Background:
  Hi there, I heard from my agent that many people Â´_>` solved my challenge last year which was joyful. You might notice something when seeing this challenge name. And yes, last year's challenge was actually a part of this final art. A game started a year ago, lost between 0&1, come from the path and back through the shadow, will you catch the 'Montage' spirit? I'm waiting for you, from the past to the future.
