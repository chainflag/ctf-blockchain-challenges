## Attention
Every team has a independent private chain. The password for account `0xAC9E27B1fABd55D3E85104d9FEB945C57d99f43A` is `tctf2018` with 10 ETH. The address of ZeroLottery is `0xb3883b88A48923187A22Ee27d4cb840a4Be68fD3`. We expose a json rpc port(`http://192.168.201.18:80`) of the private chain.

Your goal is make your ZeroLottery's balance > 500. After that, you can get the flag at `http://192.168.201.18:5000/flag?wallet=<YOUR ADDRESS>` page.

Read the source code first before have a try! Do not attack the platform!

Do not make any transactions unless you know what you are doing. Due to mining can be very slow, wait some time(maybe 2 min or more) before making a new transaction. You can not control the miner, so if you think the miner stop working, ask the one who named `md5_salt` for help. DoS can only affect your chain and we would ban your ip. If you run out your ETH, this challenge is over, no refund, just move to other challenges please.

We suggest you set up a test chain, when you are sure your exploit works, then try it on the challenge .
